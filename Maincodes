Defect Title:
Emessage screen – Unable to send when CC/BCC fields are populated in Reply/Reply All mode

Module/Screen:
SR → Emessage screen

Steps to Reproduce:

Open an existing SR.

Go to the Emessage screen.

Click Reply or Reply All on an existing message.

Enter a valid email address in the CC and/or BCC fields.

Click Send.

Actual Result:
Message is not sent when CC or BCC addresses are entered.
