Defect Title:
Emessage body – Emojis not displaying correctly when downloaded from API

Module/Screen:
SR → Emessage body (via API download)

Steps to Reproduce:

Open an existing SR and go to the Emessage screen.

In the message body, insert one or more emojis.

Send the Emessage.

Download the Emessage HTML body via the API.

Actual Result:
In the downloaded HTML body from the API, emojis are replaced with the "?" symbol.

Expected Result:
Emojis should be displayed correctly in the downloaded HTML body, exactly as they appear in the original Emessage body.
Expected Result:
Message should be sent successfully even when valid CC and/or BCC addresses are added.

Additional Notes:

Issue occurs only when CC/BCC fields are used.

Sending without CC/BCC works as expected
